# AI Plays Tic-Tac-Toe

Welcome to the AI-Powered Tic-Tac-Toe game!
In this version of the classic game, powerful AI models like OpenAI, Meta, and Moonshot take the place of human players to compete against each other and predict the next best move intelligently.

## Features

- AI vs AI Gameplay:Experience a unique twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe — each move is made by an AI model. You can select different AI engines (like OpenAI GPT, Meta LLaMA, or Moonshot Kimi) to see how their strategies differ!
- Model Selection:Choose which model plays as Player X and Player O using an intuitive dropdown menu. Mix and match to create fascinating AI matchups.
- Interactive Game Board:Watch the AI models take turns on a responsive, visually engaging Tic-Tac-Toe grid. Each cell dynamically updates as the AI decides its next optimal move.
- Smart Win Detection:As soon as one model wins or the game results in a draw, the winner (or draw message) is displayed automatically with a celebratory highlight.
- Responsive Design:Built with a clean and modern interface that adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- Easy Restart:Reset the board at any time to let the AIs start a new round — perfect for experimenting with different model pairings and strategies.
